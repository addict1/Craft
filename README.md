This is the story of a man, (child), who has a dream. Ok enough of that. So I was playing pokemon red and I found some things that seemed a little bit annoying. So, with a dream, I decided to make my own game. I assembled my team. A team of one person who knows nothing of programming and game making. But, since he was a friend I invited him anyways. So after a bit of thought, I decided that if this project actually goes quite far, nintendo would be pissed at me. I then turned to a game concept idea i thought of a while ago. But, to my sadness, i couldn't find it. This game will end up pretty good. I hope. This update was made on the 20/11/14. Hopefully I won't see this message in several years having completly forgotten this game. If you have any suggestions please do help me.
